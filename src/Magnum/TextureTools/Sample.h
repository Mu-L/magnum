@brief Sample a 1D RGB texture with linear interpolation
@m_since_latest

Expects that @p texture has at least one element and @p factor is in a
@f$ [0, 1] @f$ range. For a factor of @cpp 0.0f @ce returns the first element
of @p texture, for @cpp 1.0f @ce returns the last, values in between are a
linear interpolation of two nearest elements that are first unpacked to a
floating-point type.

Note that the @p texture is interpreted as having linear colors. Use
@ref sampleSrgb() if you want to perform conversion from sRGB values instead.
